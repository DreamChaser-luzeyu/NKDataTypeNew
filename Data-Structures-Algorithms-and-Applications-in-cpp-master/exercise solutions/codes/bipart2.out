The input graph is described below
The graph has 9 vertices
There is an edge from vertex 1 to vertex (vertices) 7  5  4  
There is an edge from vertex 2 to vertex (vertices) 9  3  
There is an edge from vertex 3 to vertex (vertices) 8  2  
There is an edge from vertex 4 to vertex (vertices) 6  1  
There is an edge from vertex 5 to vertex (vertices) 6  1  
There is an edge from vertex 6 to vertex (vertices) 7  5  4  
There is an edge from vertex 7 to vertex (vertices) 6  1  
There is an edge from vertex 8 to vertex (vertices) 9  3  
There is an edge from vertex 9 to vertex (vertices) 8  2  
The graph is bipartite
The vertex labels are
