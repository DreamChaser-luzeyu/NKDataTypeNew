By the time the execution of <code class=code>DFS</code>

completes, there is no newly labeled vertex that has an unlabeled

vertex adjacent from it.  As a result, there are no unlabeled vertices

reachable from <code class=code>v</code>.  Hence all reachable

vertices have been labeled <code class=var>label</code>.
