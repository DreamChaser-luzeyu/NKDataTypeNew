It is more convenient to draw the binary tree representation

of the tree of Figure 8.12 so that

each right child pointer as a horizontal line that connects two

siblings and each left child pointer as a vertical line that

connects a parent to one of its children.

<br><br>

The binary tree representation of the tree of Figure 8.12

is given below.
