Any sequence which always combines sets that have the same number

of elements

will do.  For example, the sequence union(1,2), union(3,4),

union(1,3) results in a tree of 4 elements and height 3.

The sequence union(5,6), union(7,8), union(5,7)

also results in a height 3 tree with 4 elements.  Performing the

operation union(1,5) now results in a height 4 tree with 8 elements.
